"""An implementation of conlleval.pl https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2000/chunking/output.html

Input is a conll file with the rightmost columns being gold and predicted tags
in that order. Sentences are separated by a blank line.

Some parts of the perl script are not replicated (this doesn't generate a latex
table) but there are other improvements like it supports files in the `IOBES`
format.

The script produces the same output as conlleval.pl for BIO and IOB tagged file.
When running on IOBES files it will produce the same F1 scores as if you
converted the file to BIO and run conlleval.pl however the accuracy will be
slightly different IOBES accuracy will always equal to or lower than BIO score.

This difference is because if the error is on a B-, I-, or O token then the
error will be in both IOBES and BIO. In the conversion from IOBES to BIO then
S- is converted to B- and E- to I- if the IOBES was correct then they will be
converted and will still be correct. If the token was wrong in that is said
it was O or something then it will be wrong after the conversion too. If it was
wrong in that the S- was tagged as B- or the E- was an I- (this is possible and
a common error) then when the gold is changed these will become correct. So it
is only possible that the conversion will make some answers correct. It won't
make anything that was correct wrong.
