# MEAD Baseline

MEAD Baseline is a library for reproducible deep learning research and fast model
development for NLP. It provides easily extensible abstractions and
implementations for data loading, model development, training, experiment tracking and export to production. 

It also provides implementations of high-performance deep learning models for various NLP tasks, against which newly developed models
can be compared. Deep learning experiments are hard to reproduce, MEAD
provides functionalities to track them. The goal is to allow a researcher to
focus on model development, delegating the repetitive tasks to the library.

## Installation

### Pip

Baseline can be installed as a Python package.

`pip install mead-baseline`

If you are using tensorflow 2 as your deep learning backend you will need to have
`tensorflow_addons` already installed or have it get installed directly with: 

`pip install mead-baseline[tf2]`

*Note for TF 2.1 users*: If you are using TF 2.1, you cannot just `pip install tensorflow_addons` (or the command above) -- it will pull a version that is dependent on a more recent version with breaking changes.  If you are running TF 2.1, use a pinned version of the addons: `pip install tensorflow_addons==0.9.1`

### From the repository

If you have a clone of this repostory and want to install from it:

```
cd layers
pip install -e .
cd ../
pip install -e .
```

This first installs `mead-layers` AKA 8 mile, a tiny layers API containing PyTorch and TensorFlow primitives, locally and then `mead-baseline`

## A Note About Versions

Deep Learning Frameworks are evolving quickly and changes are not always
backwards compatible. We recommend recent versions of whichever framework is being used underneath.  We currently run on TF versions between 1.13 and 2.2, and we recommend using at least TF 2.1.
The PyTorch backend requires at least version 1.3.0, though we recommend using a more recent version.
