## xpctl

In [mead](mead.md) we have separate **tasks** such as classify or tagger. Each task can have multiple **experiments**, each corresponding to a separate model or different hyperparameters of the same model. An experiment is uniquely identified by the id. The configuration for an experiment is uniquely identified by hash(_sha1_) of the config file. 

`xpctl` is now part of [mead-ml](https://github.com/mead-ml/xpctl) and can be installed separately from that repository
